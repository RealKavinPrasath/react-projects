# Ferrari History

Ferrari History is a simple project built to showcase Ferrari's last win in each track. This project was made as a part of my React Learning Journey.

## Topics Used

- JSX
- Props
- State (Unified State)
- Working with Data in React

These are the concepts I have learned so far in React and I wanted to try something out with what I learned. And working on this helped me improve my knowledge on the concepts through a hands-on experience.
